          Primary School
        </h3>
        <p>
          Primary Schools are for children aged 5-12. Adelaide has a wide range of primary schools in every neighbourhood, as well as Catholic and Private institutions. Education is mostly funded by the government, but some fees will apply, including paying for uniforms, extracurricular activities and excursions. Some schools will have a catchment area - if you live in this catchment area, your child will be given priority when enrolling for that school.

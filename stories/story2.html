      <h3>Luiza shared her memories of moving to Adelaide as a child</h3>
      <p>
        <i>What was your first impression of Adelaide? </i> <br>
        Lots of wide space, large residential areas and very hot air. <br><br>
        <i>What were the most noticeable differences from your home country? </i> <br>
        Flat, well-constructed roads with clear signage. Not nearly as over overcrowded and loud.<br><br>
        <i>What language barriers did you face?</i> <br>
        I did not speak English. I had a very basic knowledge of basic nouns but could not form sentences or understand others speaking to me.
<br><br>
        <i>How did the language barrier affect your day-to-day life? </i> <br>
        I had to move schools because I could not follow simple instructions in a normal classroom. I could not go anywhere alone or do any extracurricular activity.<br><br>
        <i>Did you find it difficult to fit in?</i> <br>
        Yes, for many months I could not communicate very well, and I had a different lifestyle to other children so making friends was particularly challenging. Even during friendships I had formed it was often hard to fit in. For example, at birthday parties I didn’t eat the food provided and my mum would bring my own packed lunch and that would often be an embarrassing experience.<br><br>
        <i>Which services were available to you?</i> <br>
        I participated in a “new arrivals” program at Gilles St primary school which was made up of foreign students my age who also did not speak English. The class aimed to teach elementary English and grammar to kids in higher year levels.<br><br>
        <i> What sort of support did you wish you had?</i> <br>
        I wish I was accepted in the new arrivals program much earlier and had avoided attending a normal English-speaking school in my first months. <br><br>
        <i>Do you still speak your native tongue at home? </i> <br>
        Yes

      <p>Experiences from A University of Adelaide Student</p>
    </div>

      <h3 class="titleFont">A overcame many challenges since she moved to Australia</h3>
      <p>
        A is an international student studying in the University of Adelaide. She came to Australia four years ago and has studied in a local high school. The journey started to be really hard. She could understand English, but it was not enough for academic environment. There was no international student support in her school, which has made things worse. As a result, she felt struggled in the first year. Fortunately, things changed in the second year. She has started to made friends with the Australian students. She has joined in two school ensembles, and music as a special language always brings human closer. Meanwhile she has written her final essay based on a classical Australian novel. These all have helped her understand Australian culture more deeply.
        <br><br>
        Her experience also allows her to empathise with many international students who are from developing countries and have psychological problems due to the pressure of studying - the price of studying abroad is so high that they can’t or don’t want to deal with the consequences of failing in school. And more complex cultural identities after living overseas for a long time also keep interrupting most of them. As a result of living abroad for a long while and fitting into the Australian society, they have to deal with the stronger feeling of not belonging. It may also be harmful to their mental health if there are no appropriate supports.
        <br><br>
        As a previous struggling international student, she advised that both the university and the Australian government should provide more services, especially mental health services in the students’ mother languages while the number of international students in Australia is increasing. And she also provides some advice for international students who usually just arrived, and feel lonely and stressful:
        <br><br>
        "Don’t be afraid of join the Australian students’ companies. Most of them are good people and will be kind of you."
        <br><br>
        "There is not compulsory need of social networking in the university, so don’t be too scared if you are not a social person. But doing your job as a student and finding something you were interested in were crucial, because it would be a very hard time to be in Adelaide if you stay here without these things."
        <br><br>
        "If you feel not quite right, trying to approach someone you trust in, such as your family or friends, and if there is not such person you can talk with, booking an appointment with a GP, even a psychologist or a psychiatrist. If you feel not confident to speak face to face or they feel there is no need to wait for a long time to see a doctor, there are some online services for using. Believe your English abilities, try to approach them if you need to!"</p>

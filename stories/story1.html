      <p>Russian migrants from China</p>

    <div class="gridItem grid-content blueBlock" id="stories1Content">
      <p>Nina Gorgevana and Nikolai Petrovich were both born and grew up in China. Their parents fled Russia during the Russian Revolution and settled in China. They were displaced citizens. In China, Nina worked as a school teacher and Nikolai’s family were farmers.
Nina said that she and her husband were sponsored out to Australia, thus they arrived with a debt….they owed for their passage which they had to repay. Nina and Nikolai were separated for their voyage, she came by aeroplane and he arrived by ship. Apparently, that was quite a common scenario for sponsored migrants at that time. Nina arrived in Australia in 1960 a few months later she gave birth to her first child in January of 1961.<br><br>
Upon arrival Nina and Nikolai were not given any housing assistance or financial assistance of any kind. Through their sponsors and their community they were able to secure a housing loan (once Nikolai found employment as a labourer).<br><br>
Nina said that they were lucky in the sense that they had their Russian community and church. Their sponsor was a Ukrainian man who could speak a little English. When they were settled, Nina and Nikolai sponsored their parents out of China to Australia. Living together with other family members was quite the norm. They would have two or three families living together at any one time until the other family was able to afford to purchase their own home.<br><br>
There were many struggles upon arrival - not knowing the language, or even where or what type of food was available. Nina recalled a few instances in which she really felt scared. Early on as she was walking (they walked everywhere) back from one of the children’s appointments, she began feeling unwell; she walked into a delicatessen and asked for a drink of water. The lady gave her a soft drink and Nina said she felt better. She was not even aware that you could purchase a bottle of drink. It was many years later she learned about diabetes and blood pressure. She said that because they didn’t speak English in the first few years, they would take wrappers to the supermarket to buy the same item. The way in which they learned things was as a community. One person would discover something like the Adelaide Central Markets and would share that information with the rest of the community. It was by word of mouth. Nina said it took a few years to feel confident in coping with everyday life.<br><br>
Nina made and effort to learn as much English as she could, she enrolled in English classes. After 12 years in Adelaide, she received her drivers license. With her newfound independence Nina went to TAFE and received her Diploma in Dress Making and Fashion Design.<br><br>
Nina’s love of teaching prompted her to set up a Russian school ‘School of Russian Language’ which is still running today. From there, got involved with the South Australian Secondary’s School Association and help implement Russian as a year 12 subjects. She was one of three Russian Matriculation teachers back in the late 1970s through to the 1990s and beyond. Nina constantly encouraged girls to get an education – she did not agree with the then mentality that girls will only go on to get married and have children, so they do not need an education.
Realising how difficult it was for newer migrants to settle in Adelaide and not have services Nina and few others from the other Russian communities (Orthodox, Baptist and Pentecostal) got together and petitioned the South Australian government for assistance. Thus, Ethnic Link Services was founded. Today Ethnic Link is part of Uniting Care Wesley, providing assistance to non-English speaking migrants of many nationalities.<br><br>
I asked Nina why she did what she did. Simply she said “God put us on this earth to help one another…  I had help when I arrived, but it was still very, very hard. I did not know one word of English. People come now and have no family, no friends. Who will help them?”
